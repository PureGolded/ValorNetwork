# ValorStone Network - Project Plan

## Project Purpose
ValorStone Network is a role-playing system for Minecraft, integrated with a Discord community and a website. It aims to create a rich, player-driven lore and economy, with strong account verification and moderation to ensure fair and immersive gameplay.

## Key Features
- Central API for all data and account linking
- Website with Minecraft-themed UI (pixelated fonts, book textures, item hover effects)
- Character creation with detailed forms (Name, Age, Family connections, extensive Lore)
- Wikipedia-style lore editing with draft system and version control
- Discord bot for quick info retrieval and moderation (/loresee, /mod commands)
- Minecraft plugin for gameplay enforcement and extensive event logging
- AI and manual moderation for lore and character creation
- Hardcore mode and nation mechanics for immersive roleplay
- Economy system with national banks backed by rare items
- Maintenance mode with database rollback capabilities

## How It Works
The ValorStone Network connects three platforms that players use:
- **Website**: Where you create characters, write lore, and manage your account
- **Discord Server**: Where you can quickly look up information and get community updates  
- **Minecraft Server**: Where the actual roleplay gameplay happens

All three platforms share the same information, so your character details, lore, and account status stay synchronized everywhere.

## Getting Started & Verification
- New players must complete a registration process that includes reading the rules carefully
- You'll need to connect your Discord account, website account, and Minecraft account together
- Every day, you'll get a unique code that works across all platforms to prove your identity
- Before you can play, your character must be reviewed and approved by our moderation team
- The system can detect if banned players try to return with new accounts

## Keeping Things Fair & Safe
- **Automated Content Review**: Computer systems help check that new lore follows the rules (no overpowered characters, no inappropriate content)
- **Human Moderators**: Real people review all new characters and major changes to ensure quality
- **Reporting System**: Players can report problems or unfair advantages through a ticket system
- **Strike System**: Players who break rules get warnings (up to 3 strikes) before being banned
- **Cross-Platform Enforcement**: If you're banned on one platform, it applies to all platforms
- **Fair Play Rules**: No copying real people, no creating the same character multiple times, no targeted harassment

## The Roleplay Experience
- **High Stakes**: When your character dies in combat with another player, you're temporarily banned until you create a new character
- **Nations and Politics**: Start by joining staff-created nations, with the possibility to create your own towns later
- **Player-Driven Economy**: The economy is based on rare items (like a gold standard) and run by players
- **Rich Storytelling**: Your character needs detailed background story, family connections, and ongoing lore
- **Interconnected World**: All player stories connect through a system of references and links
- **Character Requirements**: You must have an approved character and linked accounts before joining the Minecraft server
- **Organized Lore**: Stories are categorized by Nations, Towns, Characters, and Events for easy browsing

## Future Plans & Growth
- **Family-Focused Joining**: After the server launches, new players will be encouraged to join existing families
- **Upcoming Features**: Wars between nations, job systems, professional titles, and more are planned for later updates
- **Complete at Launch**: Most features will be ready when the server opens, rather than being added during gameplay
- **Community Discussions**: Discord will be used for community forums and discussions (not the website)
- **Balanced Growth**: The system is designed to handle growth, but we're planning to start small and focused
